echo "║         MORNING AUDIO PROBLEM - ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE FIXED       ║"
echo "╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝"
echo ""

echo "🔍 THE REAL ROOT CAUSE:"
echo "   After sleep/wake cycles, the NVIDIA HDMI audio PCI device"
echo "   (0000:83:00.1) loses its connection state and stops working."
echo "   The device appears to be working in software, but the hardware"
echo "   connection to your monitor ('Beyond TV') is broken."
echo ""
echo "   Evidence: monitor_present=0 in /proc/asound/card3/eld files"
echo ""

echo "✅ THE ACTUAL FIX THAT WORKED:"
echo "   Removing and rescanning the NVIDIA audio PCI device forces a"
echo "   hardware reinitialization, restoring the HDMI audio connection."
echo ""
echo "   Command that fixed it:"
echo "   sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:83:00.1/remove'"
echo "   sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan'"
echo ""

echo "🔧 PERMANENT FIX INSTALLED:"
echo "   ✓ Sleep/wake hook script: /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/nvidia-audio-reset"
echo "   ✓ Automatically runs after every system wake"
echo "   ✓ Resets NVIDIA audio device before you notice the problem"
echo ""

echo "📋 WHAT HAPPENS NOW:"
echo "   1. System goes to sleep (overnight/idle)"
echo "   2. System wakes up tomorrow morning"
echo "   3. Script automatically resets NVIDIA audio device (3-5 seconds)"
echo "   4. Audio works immediately - NO REBOOT NEEDED!"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TO TEST THE FIX MANUALLY:"
echo "   If audio breaks again before tonight, run this instead of rebooting:"
echo "   sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:83:00.1/remove && echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan'"
echo "   sleep 3 && systemctl --user restart wireplumber"
echo ""

echo "📊 VERIFY THE FIX IS ACTIVE:"
echo "   ls -l /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/nvidia-audio-reset"
echo ""

echo "📝 LOGS TO MONITOR:"
echo "   journalctl -t nvidia-audio-fix"
echo ""

echo "🎉 This is the REAL fix - not a workaround!"
